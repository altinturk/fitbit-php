## Fitbit API php wrapper

I just needed an all-in-one php wrapper to handle authentication and requests, so this piece of code has born.

Wrapper MIT-Licensed.
fitbit and everything regarding the brand, tools, api, whatnot are properties of FitBit inc.
eventual spillage of blood, sweat or tears during exercise, are under your responsability.
